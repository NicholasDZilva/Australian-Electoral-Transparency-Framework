Electoral Transparency Framework: Three Vectors of Invisible Influence

A unified, non-partisan framework to restore voter sovereignty by making modern electoral influence visible. Instead of bans or caps, it builds transparency as infrastructure—public dashboards and disclosure rules administered by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).

## The Problem: Structural Asymmetry

Modern elections are shaped by three vectors of influence that operate outside public visibility:
1.  **Algorithmic Influence:** Digital platforms amplify political content without transparency.
2.  **Financial Influence:** Campaign funding is fragmented across parties and third parties.
3.  **Advocacy Ecosystems:** Organised groups campaign alongside parties without alignment disclosure.

This creates a structural advantage for entrenched players and undermines informed voter consent.

## The Solution: A Unified Transparency Layer

This framework integrates three complementary reforms into a single, coherent system:

| Vector of Influence | Reform | Delivery Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Algorithmic** | Digital Electoral Transparency | **Algorithmic Influence Dashboard** (AEC) |
| **Financial** | Voter-Directed Funding & Transparency | **Funding Transparency Dashboard** (AEC) |
| **Advocacy** | Invisible Influence (Alignment Disclosure) | **Advocacy Ecosystem Dashboard** (AEC) |

### Core Architecture
All three components share the same design principles:
-   **Public-Facing Dashboards:** The primary voter interface.
-   **Disclosure, Not Restriction:** Regulates visibility, not speech.
-   **AEC Administration:** Leverages existing, trusted infrastructure.
-   **Audit-Based Enforcement:** Focuses on compliance after the fact.
